It has already been two months since I had the opportunity to become a member of Codesai and I cannot express with words how happy and grateful I am after joining this incredible group.

I have always considered myself as an optimist and nonconformist person, continuously looking ahead and being certain that there is something better out there for us programmers. When I found myself without the knowledge, practice and skill to lead a change from within the organisations I was working for, I decided to have a break to start building the skills required to take such a challenge in the future.

Amongst all good practices I consider testing a cornerstone for any good and sustainable development. To improve my testing skills, I contacted [Carlos](https://twitter.com/carlosble) to attend their TDD open course in Madrid. I had met him in the Agile Open Space 2013 in Tenerife where I was introduced to Agilism, Open Spaces and katas, being greatly impressed by his knowledge and humility.

After a few talks with Carlos, he offered me to join Codesai as an apprentice and I did not have to think twice about it, I had already decided from the moment he offered! I have to say, it feels like one of the best decisions I have taken in the last few years. Codesai is not only a company with developers that are well known by the community and the industry, we are a group of human beings with aligned purposes and goals that want to make both the world and the industry a better place.

I joined Codesai because I wanted to learn, I have learned many things already and so many are there waiting, still to be learned. However, I found more than knowledge, I found a group of great people that inspire me every single day.

Thank you for letting me in! :)
