I created the [Beverages Prices Refactoring kata](https://github.com/trikitrok/beverages_pricing_refactoring_kata) for the [Deliberate Practice Program](https://github.com/Codesai/practice_program) I'm running at [Lifull Connect](https://www.lifullconnect.com/) offices in Barcelona (previously [Trovit](https://www.trovit.es/index.php)). Its goal is to practice refactoring away from a bad usage of inheritance.

The code computes the price of the different beverages that are sold in a coffe house. There are some supplements that can be added to those beverages. Each supplement increases the price a bit. Not all combinations of drinks and supplements are possible.

Just having a quick look at the tests of the initial code would give you an idea of the kind of problems it might have:

If that's not enough have a look at its inheritance hierarchy:

To make things worse, we are asked to **add an optional cinnamon supplement that costs 0.05â‚¬
to all our existing catalog of beverages**. We think we should refactor this code a bit before introducing the new feature.

We hope you have fun practicing refactoring with this kata.
