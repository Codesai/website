How to propagate an event from a low level class to a top level one:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/trikitrok/09a0bb5b79de8c784064f8f616bca6b4.js"></script>

Events can only be raised from within the declaring type. Unfortunately they can't be be passed in as arguments to methods. Only **+=** and **-=** operators are allowed out of the declaring type. One way to stub out the event could be through inheritance:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/trikitrok/cbe175b360cae40a89ea621a5f42380a.js"></script>

But declaring the event as virtual and then overriding it, is very tricky: replacing the call to **RaiseEvent** to **DoSomething**, makes the test fail! Looks like events where not designed to be overridden. 

A better approach would be:
