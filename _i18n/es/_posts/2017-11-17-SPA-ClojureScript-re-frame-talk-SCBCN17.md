Last month I had the pleasure of giving a talk at the <a href="http://scbcn.github.io/">Software Craftsmanship Barcelona 2017 conference</a> about what my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/zesc">Francesc</a> and I have been learning lately while working on the mobile and browser versions of a SPA using ClojureScript and <a href="https://github.com/Day8/re-frame">re-frame</a>.
<br><br> 
I talked mainly about <b>how re-frame's effects and coeffects, re-frame's subscriptions and modelling a UI as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">FSM</a>s place you in a pit of success</b>, i. e., a design that, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/">according to Jeff Atwood</a>, "<i>makes it easy to do the right things and annoying (but not impossible) to do the wrong things</i>".
<br><br> 
It was my first talk in a big conference and I had some technical problems, so I was very nervous at the beginning. After a while I relaxed and felt better. In the end I received more questions than I expected and very nice feedback.
<br><br> 
I'd like to thank Modesto for lending me his computer when mine crashed just before the talk and helping me relax.
<br><br> 
This is the video of the talk, (thanks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AutentiaMedia">Autentia</a> for recording all the talks and for being so kind to me when I was having technical difficulties). I hope you'll find it interesting:

and these are <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Rha0DTEdDfq_uoek6ksju3vPnJkiyS3zBfAhFvsf5Fo/edit?usp=sharing">the slides</a> that I've improved after the talk using Modesto's feedback (thanks!!): .
<br><br> 
Thanks to Francesc and all the people in <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ClojureBCN/">Clojure Developers Barcelona Group</a>, <a href="http://www.greenpowermonitor.com/">Green Power Monitor</a> and <a href="https://www.codesai.com/">Codesai</a> that contributed to improve the talk with their feedback. Also thanks to my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/adelatorrefoss">Antonio</a> for "persuading" me to give a talk in a conference.
<br><br> 
Finally, I'd also like to thank <a href="http://scbcn.github.io/">Software Craftsmanship Barcelona 2017 conference</a> organizers for giving me the opportunity to talk at such a great conference and for all the effort they put to make this conference better, edition after edition.
