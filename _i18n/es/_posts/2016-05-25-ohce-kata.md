I created this short and simple kata to practice outside-in TDD using test doubles for a mentoring <a href="http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/">Álvaro</a> and I are doing in <a href="https://twitter.com/magento">Magento Barcelona</a>:

**ohce** is a console application that echoes the reverse of what you input through the console.

Even though it seems a silly application, **ohce** knows a thing or two.

1. When you start oche, it greets you differently depending on the current time, but only in Spanish: 
    - Between 20 and 6 hours, **ohce** will greet you saying:  *¡Buenas noches < your name >!*
    - Between 6 and 12 hours, **ohce** will greet you saying:  *¡Buenos días < your name >!*
    - Between 12 and 20 hours, **ohce** will greet you saying:  *¡Buenas tardes < your name >!*
2. When you introduce a palindrome, **ohce** likes it and after reverse-echoing it, it adds *¡Bonita palabra!*
3. **ohce** knows when to stop, you just have to write *Stop!* and it'll answer *Adios < your name >* and end.

This is an example of using **ohce** during the morning:

    $ ohce Pedro
    > ¡Buenos días Pedro!
    $ hola
    > aloh
    $ oto
    > oto
    > ¡Bonita palabra!
    $ stop
    > pots
    $ Stop!
    > Adios Pedro

I hope you enjoy doing it.
