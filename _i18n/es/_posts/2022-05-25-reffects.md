## 1. Introduction.

I’ve been wanting to write this post for a very long time, but life happens… 

Three years ago we started developing and using [reffects](https://github.com/trovit/reffects), a Javascript framework for developing single page applications (SPAs) that uses an event-driven unidirectional-flow functional architecture. It promotes a functional programming style by using the [*effects as data* pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EdXaWfoslc), in which event handlers are pure functions, and effects and coeffects are used to manage side effects and side causes, respectively.

In this post I’d like to tell you why and how we decided to create *reffects* and how it has worked for us.

## 2. A bit of context.

Three year ago we started working with a team in [Trovit](https://www.trovit.es/) now a part of [Lifull Connect](https://www.lifullconnect.com/). 

### The product and its front-end stack.

They were developing a dashboard application called *Partners* at the time. Blabla lo que hacía Partners.

*Partners*’s front end was mostly developed using [Backbone.js](https://backbonejs.org/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/). *Backbone* was one of the first MVC frameworks used to write [single-page applications (SPAs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application), and it was very popular in its heyday (around 10 years ago). It started to be disregarded when [Angular](https://angular.io/) appeared. Although *Backbone* is a good framework and there are very famous apps based on it (see 10 Web Apps Made with Backbone.js), it’s rarely  considered for new projects nowadays. This might be explained in part by the appearance of new ideas that had simplified front-end development, such as the [virtual DOM](https://www.codecademy.com/article/react-virtual-dom) or [unidirectional data flow architectures](https://staltz.com/unidirectional-user-interface-architectures.html).

This was a problem for Trovit because they were having a difficult time retaining and attracting talented front-end developers because of *Backbone* and *jQuery*. Many of their hiring processes had abruptly failed when the candidates found out they would have to work with *Backbone* and *jQuery*. 

Some isolated developers in the team started substituting some *Backbone views* with *[React](https://reactjs.org/) components* but this effort was not enough to improve their poor development experience, though. *React* can’t replace *Backbone* because they have different purposes. *React* is great technology for the views, but it is not concerned with managing state. Moreover not all developers were on board with using *React*.

Thinking that a more modern stack would help them attract talent, the company decided to start gradually introducing *React* in the project.

### The team.
The team was mainly composed of backenders, that “touched” the JavaScript code now and then, and a few frontenders. We had the intention of ending this division between backenders and frontenders, and have fullstack developers that could work in any part of the application. Not only that, we wanted to use TDD, refactoring and other XP practices. The team was far from being able to do that.

### Uninhabitable architecture.

Front-end code presents characteristics, such as, asynchrony, user interaction, using browser APIs or DOM manipulation, that make testing it quite hard. Poor testability is often related to design problems <-(nota diciendo que es una idea de la que hemos hablado antes en el blog con links a algunos posts) . In order to sustainably and effectively test a front-end application, it is crucial to use a clear architecture that adequately separates concerns and reduces the pain of testing.

In the case of *Partners*, a poor separation of concerns, a lot of *“glue code”* and imperative libraries used without any kind of wrapping resulted in a vicious cycle in which the team was not able to write tests for a legacy code that they had to keep evolving. 

As a result *Partners*’ front end was scarcely tested. The team didn’t know how to test it, but its poor design made the barrier to testing really high. This dynamic was leading to a kind of “learned helplessness” in the team in which they were suffering the pain of an uninhabitable code base while not having the means or knowledge to improve the situation.

The team needed to learn and master advanced techniques to test legacy code in order to break that vicious cycle. And even after mastering that, the friction to develop new features would still be high.

Not a single f***ing test

### The situation: pressures, fusion, blabla.

### Strategic concerns and constraints.

To sum up given the context we’ve just described and the immediate pressures we were going to face soon we needed to find an architecture and stack that somehow fulfilled the following requirements:

Que sea atractivo para nuevos candidatos
Que mejore la experiencia de desarrollo
Que reduzca la barrera al testing
Que nos proporciones una estratégia de migración progresiva y robusta
Que cualquier miembro del equipo llegue en un tiempo razonable a poder desarrollar nuevas implementaciones así como modificar código existente de forma sostenible en el tiempo

We had some ideas blabla. We had lived a similar situation blabla both in a greenfield and in a legacy context.

## 3. Spike: looking for a sustainable alternative architecture and testing strategy.
The focus of the spike was finding an architecture whose constraints will place the team in an advantageous position in the medium to long term by making it less hard to follow good practices (testing, TDD, clearly separating responsibilities, reducing accidental complexity, etc). Given the poor skills of the team at that time, both in working in front-end applications and in technical practices, and the existing pressure, we especially wanted an architecture with strong constraints that could greatly simplify how the front end was written in order to lower in a great extent the existing barriers to testing. 

We wanted to check if it would be possible to have a front-end architecture with:

An approach to state management that reduces barriers to testing as much as possible, so that the team could very easily **test most of the code they write and learn bit by bit more advanced testing skills for those less frequent harder to test parts of the code** (normally related with side-effects).
A way to reduce logic in views as much as possible in order to make them so “dumb”, that a strategy like subcutaneous testing would be possible. In this strategy we test the logic under the views which become declarative and “dumb”, so we may decide not to test them. This can be very cost effective (reducing time and difficulty), but only if all useful logic is kept out of the UI.

To achieve that we needed an architecture which separated very clearly the different concerns we may find in front-end applications. 

## First decisions.

### Unidirectional data flow.
From the outset we wanted to use a unidirectional data flow architecture because it reduces accidental complexity and takes full advantage of *React*’s *one-way binding*.
In *unidirectional data flow architectures*, the data, either coming from the server or through user interaction, enter the application using a unique well defined interface (actions, events or another mechanism) which starts the update cycle. Whenever the application state gets modified by this update cycle, any views related to that changed  state will react rerendering again. 
This process is much easier to reason about than the bidirectional binding of MVC architectures like *Backbone*’s. In those MVC architectures it might happen that many views are bound to the same property in a model, or even that properties from other models could be bound to the same property of another model. This makes it very hard to reason about what’s going on and understand the consequences of a given change if you’re not extremely careful.


### Command-query separation. 
We also wanted an architecture with a strong separation of concerns between *commands* and *queries*. Here queries are understood as retrieving data from the front-end *application state* (a.k.a. store or model in *redux*) and commands are understood as logic that updates that state. This simplifies *business logic* and reduces *accidental complexity* because those concerns are not mixed in the code anymore. It also avoids having to store and synchronise *derived state*. The idea is to  store the least amount of data possible in the *application state*, and have *queries* compute on the fly from the state any values needed in the views.


—----------------------------

3. Strong isolation of side effects from business logic that would make testing very easy. This way most of the business logic become pure, which can be tested very easily not requiring great testing skills, and only a small fraction of the code becomes effectfull which requiring more advanced testing skills el equipo pueda testear de manera muy fácil la gran mayoría del código que escriba, e ir aprendiendo poco a poco técnicas de testing más avanzadas para partes menos frecuentes pero más difíciles de testear (normalmente las relacionadas con side-effects).
4 Remove as much logic as possible from the views, making them so “dumb”, that a strategy like subcutaneous testing would be possible. This strategy can be very cost effective (reducing time and difficulty), if all useful logic is kept out of the UI.


Para ello necesitamos una arquitectura que separe muy bien las diferentes responsabilidades que uno encuentra en el front end.

###4.3. A possible solution: effects and coeffects and subcutaneous testing. <- [no sé donde encajarlo, quizás como resultado del spike]
